This app is specially written for Vault project

Simple Todo app written in Python Flask for deploying in my own project with HCP Vault.
This Todo app needs database to store notes. But to have access to this database, this app needs to takie first password from HCP Vault.

Requirements:
- it needs to be run in EC2 instance, because app will get secret from HCP Vault which access will be achieved my meta-data (HCP Vault will have AWS auth method --> app auth against Vault by IAM role attached to EC2 instance)
- Postgresql database - tested in Postgresql 13,14,15 versions.
- app runs in UWSGI server on port 8080 (uwsgi.ini)
